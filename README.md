# Chase Roohms

Hi! I’m Chase Roohms, a DevOps Engineer who has built his career around a passion for automation and problem solving. With a background in software development and IT security, I approach challenges from multiple perspectives and enjoy finding smarter, more efficient ways to keep systems running smoothly.

A natural tinkerer, I spend my free time exploring new tools, running home servers, and building side projects. That same curiosity drives my work - streamlining processes, reducing manual efforts, and creating solutions that scale.
